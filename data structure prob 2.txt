Algorithm: Dot Product and Orthogonality Check

Procedure dot_product(vector1: array of real, vector2: array of real) -> real
    Declare ps as real
    Initialize ps to 0
    For i from 0 to length(vector1) - 1
        Add vector1[i] * vector2[i] to ps
    End For
    Return ps
End Procedure

Procedure check_orthogonality(vectors: array of array of real)
    For i from 0 to length(vectors) - 1
        For j from i + 1 to length(vectors) - 1
            Declare result as real
            Call dot_product with parameters vectors[i] and vectors[j], and store the result in result
            If result equals 0
                Output "Vectors ", i+1, " and ", j+1, " are orthogonal."
            Else
                Output "Vectors ", i+1, " and ", j+1, " are not orthogonal."
            End If
        End For
    End For
End Procedure

// Example usage:
Declare vectors as array of array of real
Set vectors to [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [2, -2, 0]]

Call check_orthogonality with parameter vectors
